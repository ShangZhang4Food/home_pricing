# House Pricing Prediction

This is a project aims to predict the pricing of homes by taking the following steps:

1. Data scraping: The data is scraped from Kaggle. 
2. Data cleaning: The null values are either converted to zeros or its variables are converted to categorical variabless. 
3. EDA: The data is visualized to identify trends, correlations and outliers. 
4. Modeling and comparison: A few models such as random forest, linear regression are developed and compared based on their accuracies and RMSE on the validation set. 
5. Hyperparameter tuning: The best performing model is selected to further improve the metrics on the validation set by tuning the hyperparameters. 
6. Prediction: The prediction of house pricing in a test set is generated.
